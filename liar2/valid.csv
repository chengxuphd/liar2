As the regulations stand now, it appears that drainage canals designated as Class III waters in Central Florida would have to meet the same numeric nutrient standards as the Wekiva River.

Three, the state is proposing a change to the rules that could exempt many of the state's drainage canals.

The congressman misspoke. The committee never has considered what should be in the salad bars of, say, restaurants or grocery stores. Brat’s office said the congressman was referring to school salad bars. Brat points to the committee’s May passage of a bill providing free breakfasts and lunches for students from low-income homes. The measure does not specify what vegetables should be served, and the panel spent no time haggling over amounts of lettuce, carrots and tomatoes. Setting nutritional standards would be left to the USDA. The bill largely would reauthorize free-meals legislation passed in 2010 that prioritized serving healthy food to students. In the aftermath, the USDA established copious regulations that include minimum weekly servings of green and red-orange vegetables and legumes. Many schools have salad bars, and it can be argued that Congress has allowed the USDA to regulate their contents. But it’s hard to imagine any salad bar worth its salt not offering a mixture of vegetables.  So Brat’s statement that the education committee is deciding salad bar contents - in schools or, perhaps, anywhere - is a stretch, and we rate it ."

In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. We rate the statement . Update:   After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack ""an act of terror"" two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada . ""As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice,"" Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. ""And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America."" So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word ""terror."" But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked:  ""We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?"" Here is Obama’s reply: ""Well, we’re still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I don’t want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests."" So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack. By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video. Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The president’s words did not correct that impression. So while Obama did use the word ""terror,"" there is also some  to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group.

There’s simply no support for the assertion that the law was passed by a ""strong majority."" It was passed along party lines in a sharply partisan climate, and the 60 votes in the Senate were the minimum needed to keep Republicans from bottling it up in a filibuster. But the ""unprecedented"" idea is more nuanced. It’s without question that the Supreme Court overturning a law passed by Congress -- by any margin -- is a common and routine occurrence, and by no means without precedent. Volokh gave us a close analogy with the case of Boerne vs. Flores , a religious freedom law that glided through Congress but was held unconstitutional by a majority of the court, including two of its liberal justices. However, Obama’s elaboration a day later at least gives us more to think about. He argued that invalidation of the health care law would represent a court action unseen since the Great Depression on an issue that affects every American. Ornstein echoed that interpretation, saying that a ruling by the court which overturns a major social policy and challenges prior court rulings would be unprecedented. But we’re taking Obama literally, and that historical perspective was not reflected in his original statement, which is what we're ruling on. He simply said the law passed with a strong majority and overturning it would be unprecedented.  and . We rate the statement ."

Newsom claimed iPhones cost $399 while one-year of health care costs $10,345. The lieutenant governor is right about the phone cost, though he selected the cheapest iPhone featured on Apple’s website. In coming up with his health care cost estimate, Newsom’s spokesman cited a federal report showing the nation’s overall health care costs were expected to surpass $10,000 per capita for the first time in 2016. That figure does not necessarily mean everyone is spending $10,345 on health care. Costs vary greatly among individuals. About 5 percent of the population — those who are most frail or sick — accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to the Associated Press.

He has a bachelor's degree from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. McAuliffe has lived in Fairfax County for more than 20 years, is married and has five children.
 ",virginia,7,4,3,16,7,4,a debate,"McAuliffe says, ""Every single Petersburg school was accredited when I left office,"" implying there was a turnaround in the city’s scholastic performance during his time as governor. He’s dead  if you look at the end of his term in January 2018, when none of the city’s public schools was fully accredited by the state based on standardized testing, three were denied accreditation, and three were partially certified. There’s a one-year lag in Virginia’s school accreditation, however, and McAuliffe’s campaign says he was referring to 2019 ratings that reflected Petersburg's academic performance from a year earlier, when McAuliffe left office. It’s a credible argument that McAuliffe should be judged on the 2019 rates, but it’s also highly advantageous to him because standards were eased that year and no Virginia public school was denied accreditation.  Two of Petersburg’s six schools were fully accredited in 2019, while 92% of schools across the state met that ideal. The other four were conditionally accredited, meaning they were performing below standards in at least one area and were required to take corrective actions. They were among the worst-performing 7% of Virginia schools. So there are problems with McAuliffe’s , even when we give him the advantage of using the 2019 ratings. By saying all Petersburg schools were accredited - and deftly avoiding the distinction between fully and conditionally accredited - he creates a  impression of the city’s progress during his term. We rate McAuliffe’s statement .  "

But California’s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas’ 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California’s GDP expanded faster than Texas’ GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown’s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years.   Brown, like the state’s economy in recent years, is on the right track.

Trump presented this figure as a hard fact to make his case, and not as the rough, high-end estimate that it is. The figure matches a 2013 study by a group that wants to reduce immigration, FAIR. It’s uncertain how much immigrants in the United States illegally cost taxpayers, but FAIR’s data is largely based on broad estimates and assumptions. Another report by a conservative think tank pegged the amount at about $85 billion a year. Reports by pro-immigration or neutral groups have come in significantly lower, and other reports have been inconclusive. Estimating the costs of illegal immigration is extremely difficult and produces dramatically different figures, depending on the source. Yes, there are costs.

The information came from sources that attempted to track the political giving of the Kochs and the biggest unions. But there are some complications with the numbers. On the Koch side, the sources Trudeau cited did not say that all of the money connected to David and Charles Koch was their personal money. The Kochs have played a key role in creating a unique legal mechanism to raise and spend money that obscures the ultimate donors, and the nature of that mechanism gives them a high level of of control over how it is spent. To some extent, unions also feed into third-party money operations. And union political activity is spread much wider and among more organizations than the Kochs’ giving. In short, a  apples-to-apples comparison is quite difficult. That said, one independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did in 2012. How does all of this shake out? Trudeau goes too far in ascribing all of the money to the Kochs but the ratio he offers is in the ballpark of what we can determine at the federal level. We rate the  ."
